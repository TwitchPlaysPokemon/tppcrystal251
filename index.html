		<p>
		Holy Bird Jesus! After months of waiting, it's finally out! This page is<br>
		where you can download <b>TwitchPlaysPok&eacute;mon Anniversary Crystal 251,</b><br>
		which was played on stream between February 14 and March 14, 2016.<br><br>
		You will find three links in the Downloads section.  Two of them are<br>
		.ips files.  These are based on vanilla Crystal and Crystal Rev.A,<br>
		respectively, and can be applied to a clean copy of vanilla Crystal<br>
		using the normal methods.  These patches do not interface with the<br>
		advanced external AI we showcased on the stream.</p>
		<p>
		The third file is a .zip archive, pokecrystal_ai.zip.  When unzipped,<br>
		you will find a patch file, an emulator package, and a bunch of Python<br>
		and Lua script files.  This is a minimal directory structure for run-<br>
		ning the AI along with the game.</p>
		<p>
		In the following sections, we will explain how to set up the ROMs and run<br>
		the AI.
