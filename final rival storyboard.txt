beat lance as normal

lance heals you before enshrining you in the HoF

rival rushes in with marys movement (stright at you fast)

Challenges you, claiming that they just beat the elite 4 challenge too

BATTLE

some post battle talk

oak walks in using old script

oak talks a bunch about the usual stuff

rival tries to talk more to catch up, lance interupts to do HoF

rivals panics they lose track of you again, more mary movement

HoF time
